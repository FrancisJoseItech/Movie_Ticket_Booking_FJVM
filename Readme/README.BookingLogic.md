🎟️ Booking Logic - Movie Ticket Booking App
This document explains the core logic, flow, and components involved in the ticket booking feature of the Movie Ticket Booking App. It includes how users select seats, confirm bookings, and how duplicate bookings are handled.

📌 Overview
Users can book seats for a movie show if they are logged in. The booking process includes:

Viewing available shows.

Selecting seats.

Making payment (via Stripe).

Finalizing booking.

📁 Backend Models Involved
📄 Booking Model

{
  user: ObjectId, // Reference to logged-in user
  show: ObjectId, // Reference to selected show
  seats: [String], // List of selected seat labels (e.g., ["S1", "S2"])
  totalPrice: Number,
  bookingTime: Date,
  paymentStatus: "paid" | "pending" | "failed"
}

📄 Show Model

{
  movieId: ObjectId, // Ref to movie
  theaterId: ObjectId, // Ref to theater
  date: Date,
  time: String,
  price: Number,
  bookedSeats: [String] // All seats booked for this show
}


⚙️ Booking Flow
1. User Visits Booking Page
Component: BookShowPage.jsx

Data fetched: Show details, including booked seats and theater configuration.

Seat grid rendered dynamically using SeatSelector.

2. Seat Selection
SeatSelector.jsx allows users to:

Click to select available seats (green)

Prevent selecting already booked seats (red)

3. Payment & Booking Confirmation
On clicking "Book Now", the following happens:

Validates that at least one seat is selected.

Calculates total price.

Calls Stripe Checkout session (createCheckoutSession).

On payment success, booking is saved.

🧠 Booking Creation Logic (Server-side)
File: createBooking controller

Checks:

If user has already booked this show.

If so, merges new seats into the existing booking.

Prevents booking already booked seats.

Also updates:

bookedSeats array in the Show document.

Ensures no double bookings.

🛑 Duplicate Booking Prevention
Handled using:

const alreadyBooked = seats.some(seat => show.bookedSeats.includes(seat));
let existingBooking = await Booking.findOne({ user: userId, show: showId });


If a booking exists, it's updated instead of creating a duplicate.
